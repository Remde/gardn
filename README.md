You can see the project in its current state in this link: [161.35.136.196](http://161.35.136.196/).<br />

Gardn is an anonymous web message app based on React (Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js) made by [Fernando Remde](https://www.github.com/Remde) and [Bruno Moraes](https://www.github.com/brunosdm). It's deployed to our Linux remote server using nginx for the front-end and pm2 for the back-end. The server and client have been containerized using Docker. <br />To start it in development mode, run the client with:

### `npm start`

And the server with:

### `node server.js`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You might need Docker or manually install the dependencies with npm i both for client and server. 

<br />
Work in progress.
